# Value My Car - Smart Used Car Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
**Value My Car - Smart Used Car Price Prediction** is a dynamic web application designed to provide accurate price predictions for used cars. Built using the **V0 AI tool**, this project leverages AI-driven automation to streamline development while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency.

## 🚀 Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login/signup functionality.
- **Car Price Prediction**: Predicts used car prices based on user inputs.
- **AI-Powered Development**: Utilizes **V0 AI tool** for rapid and efficient development.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly and responsive design.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implements a **stacking methodology** combining **Linear Regression, Lasso, and Random Forest models** for enhanced accuracy.
- **REST API**: Backend APIs for seamless interaction between frontend and machine learning model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
### **Frontend:**
- V0 AI Tool
- React.js
- Redux (for state management)
- Material-UI (for styling and UI components)

### **Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (as database)

### **Machine Learning Model:**
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Stacking methodology (Linear Regression + Lasso + Random Forest)



## 📦 Installation & Setup
### **1. Clone the Repository**
Run this command in your console 
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://v0.dev/chat/b/b_wnARmSc36jG"
```

### **2. Backend Setup**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### **3. Frontend Setup**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## 🎯 Usage
1. Register or Login to the application.
2. Enter details of the used car (brand, year, fuel type, etc.).
3. Click on **Predict Price** to get an estimated value.
4. View the predicted price instantly.

## 📊 Machine Learning Model Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**: The dataset is preprocessed, removing missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Important features are selected and scaled.
3. **Model Training**: A stacking model using **Linear Regression, Lasso, and Random Forest** is trained.
4. **Prediction**: User inputs are fed into the trained model to estimate car prices.

## 🔥 Future Enhancements
- Add more ML models to improve prediction accuracy.
- Implement a recommendation system for better pricing insights.
- Provide a graphical analysis of market trends.
